Hello! I am a final-year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/), working with [Nan Jiang](http://nanjiang.cs.illinois.edu/). Prior to that, I got my B.S. in Statistics from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). I have also spent time at Simons Institute, Microsoft Research (Montr√©al and Asia), and JPMorgan Chase Applied AI & Machine Learning.

My research focus is reinforcement learning (RL). I have explored various directions including offline/online RL under general function approximation, reward-free RL, representation learning, nonstationary RL, and Bayesian RL. I am also broadly interested in other machine learning topics.
